This is a project helps me practice Javafx with Scene Builder, also I just really want to create a money keeper program to see my spending everyday

*** Must have function: ***
1.  a pre-defined [daily life] section for day-to-day spending tracking, and a [work] section for other spending
2.  able to add or delete a record/transaction to or from a listview of transaction
3.  able to record transaction's amount, income or payment (as in flow and out flow), category (food, shopping, etc ..) and a          
    short memo for this transaction
4.  able to pick a date 
5.  able to show a pie chart of different transaction, showing which category takes up the most percentage
6.  able to show a summary of out flow and in flow


*** Nice to have function: ***
1.  sort list by date
2.  modify a transaction
